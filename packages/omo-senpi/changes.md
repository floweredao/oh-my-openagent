## 2026-09-30 - claude-code: acquire before the auth check, from the provisioned runtime, with progress (#9276)

- `src/components/claude-code/index.ts`: the component now also runs on `input`, which senpi's `prompt()` emits
  before `checkAuth` (`emitInput`, then `checkAuth`, then `emitBeforeAgentStart`), so a prompt from a
  `claude login`-only user downloads the executable before the ambient auth probe needs it. `before_agent_start` stays
  for turns an extension starts (they skip `input`), registered `previewSafe` and skipping the prompt-cache preview.
  The pin and cache root come from `claudeCodeRuntimeDir` (`OMO_PACKAGE_DIR`, else `dirname(execPath)`), since the
  compiled launcher pins the provisioned runtime there while `execPath` can still be the downloaded binary.
  A progress status (`omo-claude-code`: `Downloading Claude Code <version>: N% of M MB`, every 10%) shows while the
  tarball streams (`acquire.ts` `onProgress`). New `applyCachedClaudeCode` lets the compiled launcher point the engine
  at an already-downloaded copy before it starts.
- Limit: on the launch that downloads, the startup ambient probe may already have cached "not signed in" for 30 s
  (`availability.ts` `AMBIENT_STATUS_TTL_MS`); the next prompt after that window, and every later launch, resolve it.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile e2e: lane-beats-recommended-models proves a real recommended-models switch (#9238)

- `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs`: `lane-beats-recommended-models` serves `mock-1`, `glm-5.3` and
  `gpt-6-astra` on `chatgpt-subscription` + `opencode-go`, so no provider serves its engine provider default
  (`gpt-6.1-sol`, `kimi-k3`). The session starts first-available on off-ladder `mock-1`, senpi's recommended-models
  builtin switches to `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-astra`, and Daily · Normal still wins with `opencode-go/glm-5.3` max.
  The old fixture's
  only `gpt-6-sol` entry was the engine's initial provider-default record, which senpi#2393 moved to `gpt-6.1-sol`;
  the builtin never switched there. `gpt-6-astra` keeps its ladder rung across senpi#2394's Sol-slot move.
- `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e.mjs`: that scenario's checks skip the initial-model record. `started_off_recommended_ladder`
  requires the first `model_change` to be `mock-1`, and `recommended_models_switched_first` requires the builtin's
  `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6-astra` change to come after it and before the lane's `opencode-go/glm-5.3`.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile: Recommended leads its GPT-6 Sol slot with gpt-6.1-sol medium, gpt-6-sol behind it (senpi#2394)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `recommended` replaces its `gpt-6-sol` (medium) rung with
  `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) on `GPT_6_1_PROVIDERS` (`chatgpt-subscription|openai`), immediately followed by `gpt-6-sol`
  (medium) on the shared `GPT_PROVIDERS` ranking, so Copilot and OpenCode Zen, which do not serve 6.1 Sol, still resolve
  GPT-6 Sol. senpi#2394 makes the same switch in `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS`; OmO keeps the extra `gpt-6-sol` rung, and
  the header comment says so. The lanes are unchanged. Telemetry already carries `gpt-6.1-sol` (#9214).
- Tests: `builtin-profiles.test.ts` pins the seven-rung chain and the providers of both Sol rungs; `resolve.test.ts`
  resolves `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6.1-sol` medium when the subscription serves it next to `gpt-6-sol`, and
  `github-copilot/gpt-6-sol` medium on a Copilot-only registry; `index.test.ts` applies both at session start.
  `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs` adds `unset-gpt-6-1-sol` and `unset-copilot-gpt-6-sol`.
- Docs: the Recommended ladder in `docs/guide/agent-model-matching.md`, `docs/guide/overview.md`,
  `docs/guide/installation.md` and `docs/reference/omo-json.md`.
- `plugin/extensions/` bundles regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the chain change.

## 2026-09-30 - lsp: post-edit install nudges stay inside projects and appear once per server (#9223)

- `components/lsp/post-edit-outcome.ts` (moved out of `index.ts`) turns a daemon `not_installed` availability into the structured post-edit outcome, carrying `serverId`, `installDecisionTool` and a recorded decision.
- `components/lsp/index.ts` `handlePostEditDiagnosticsToolResult` classifies each edited file against the session cwd and the engine-resolved agent dir (`resolveSessionAgentDir`, else `resolveAgentHome`): files outside a project, in the agent dir, or in a temp dir get no nudge, and each server is nudged once per session (reset on compaction).
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux for the change above.

## 2026-09-30 - memory/kibitzer: connected-first sidecar model order (#9216)

- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-connected-order.ts` (new) `orderKibitzerCandidatesByConnection`: with a known, non-empty availability list the first connected candidate leads and unconnected ones trail; none connected returns the providers to connect.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.ts` `resolveKibitzerSidecarModel` applies it to category-sourced resolutions and returns `category_unavailable` when nothing is connected. The `task` tool path is untouched.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the change above; `build-extension.mjs --check` and `build-install.mjs --check` pass on the regenerated tree.

## 2026-09-30 - model-profile: Geeky · Normal leads with gpt-6.1-sol medium; telemetry knows the 6.1 Sol ids (#9214)

- `src/components/model-profile/builtin-profiles.ts`: `geeky-normal` is `gpt-6.1-sol` (medium) on `chatgpt-subscription|openai`
  (the new `GPT_6_1_PROVIDERS`: Copilot and OpenCode Zen do not serve 6.1 Sol, and every builtin rung must name a pair the
  product knows), then `gpt-5.6-sol` (medium) on the shared `GPT_PROVIDERS` ranking. The `recommended` row and every other
  profile are unchanged.
- `src/components/telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: `gpt-6.1-sol` and `gpt-6.1-sol-fast` join the `chatgpt-subscription`,
  `openai` and `openai-codex` vocabularies and `gpt-6.1-sol` the `vercel` one, so the new deep-low rungs export as themselves
  instead of `custom`; `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated from the schemas.
- Tests: `builtin-profiles.test.ts` pins the two-rung chain, `resolve.test.ts` resolves `chatgpt-subscription/gpt-6.1-sol`
  medium when the subscription serves both, and `index.test.ts` applies it at session start; the Copilot-only and GPT-6-only
  cases still resolve 5.6 Sol and report unavailable. `scripts/qa/model-profile-e2e-scenarios.mjs` `geeky-normal-sol` serves
  `gpt-6.1-sol` next to `gpt-5.6-sol` and expects 6.1 Sol.
- `plugin/extensions/omo.js`, `omo-task.js`, `omo-init-deep-advisor.js` regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for
  the chain, profile and vocabulary changes; `omo-member.js`, `memory-run-supervisor.mjs` and `omo-computer-use.js` rebuilt
  byte-identical, so they are unchanged.

## 2026-09-29 - plugin bundles carry the typed launch_spec_insecure start failure (#9208)

- `plugin/extensions/omo-task.js`, `omo-member.js`, `omo.js` (source-digest marker only) and `plugin/runtime/rollback-migrate.js`
  regenerated on linux/amd64 (node 24, bun 1.4.2) for the senpi-task change: a task host that refuses a group- or
  world-writable launch spec now fails the start typed `launch_spec_insecure` with the spec path and `chmod 644 <path>`,
  and rollback strips the new reason like every post-R0 reason. No adapter source changed.

## memory, telemetry: Kibitzer recall runs on a Z.ai-only or Xiaomi-only machine (#9202)

- `memory/kibitzer/sidecar-model.test.ts`: with only `zai` or only `xiaomi` logged in and no quick config, the sidecar
  resolves `zai/glm-5.3-flash` or `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` at `low`. On dev both refused with `beyond_category`,
  because the quick chain had no rung for them. The chain change is in senpi-task.
- `telemetry/model-vocabulary.ts`: adds `glm-5.3-flash` under `zai` and `zai-coding-cn`, and `mimo-v2.6-flash` under
  `xiaomi`, so the new rungs export by name. `docs/reference/senpi-telemetry.md` is regenerated.

## thread, task: agent state stays out of the user's repository (#9201, DESKTOP-31)

- `components/thread/live-surface.ts` `defaultThreadStateDirectory`: the thread tools' mailbox and receipts move from
  `<project>/.omo/thread-tools` to the same per-project folder as the task state
  (`@oh-my-opencode/senpi-task` `resolveProjectStateDirectory`); a pre-existing in-project folder keeps being used.
- `components/task/engine-state-dir.test.ts`: a fresh project stays empty after the engine persists task state, a
  pre-existing `.omo/senpi-task` is kept, and `task.state_dir` wins.
- Root `test-setup.ts` drops an inherited `OMO_`/`SENPI_`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, so a test run started inside a live
  session resolves agent-dir state under the hermetic HOME, as in CI.

## skill-commands, skills: argument-taking skills wait for their arguments in the slash picker (#9168)

- `skills/{hyperplan,init-deep,mass-ulw,ulw-loop,ulw-plan,ulw-research}/SKILL.md` and the shared-pool
  `ulw-execute`, `refactor` and `remove-ai-slops` declare `argument-hint`. From senpi#2258 on, the picker reads it
  (`Skill.argumentHint`) and Enter on a `skill:<name>` row fills `/skill:<name> ` and waits instead of submitting the
  skill empty. Skills that take no arguments stay hint-less and still submit on one Enter.
- `components/skill-commands/autocomplete.ts`: a bare alias row mirrors its own `skill:<name>` row on the same page,
  taking its description (which carries the hint) and `awaitsArguments`, so `/ulw-execute` waits exactly when
  `/skill:ulw-execute` does. `pi.getCommands()` carries no hint, so the page row is the source. Without the skill row
  the alias falls back to the command description and submits as before.
- `components/skill-commands/argument-hints.test.ts` parses every shipped SKILL.md with the engine's own
  `parseFrontmatter` (native copy over the shared one, as `sync-skills.mjs` ships them) and pins the set of hinted
  skills.

## computer-use, x-search: a feature skill yields to a loaded same-name skill and honors disabled_skills (#9160)

- `components/bundled-skills/contributed-skill.ts`: `resolveContributedSkill` decides one `resources_discover` pass for a
  skill a component contributes on its own. `disabled_skills` hides it (`readDisabledSkills`, now shared with the
  bundled-skills component). A `skill:<name>` entry in `pi.getCommands()` whose `sourceInfo.path` is not ours means
  senpi already loaded a same-name skill, which wins first-path either way, so ours is withheld instead of becoming a
  "Skill conflicts" collision. Our own path left over from an earlier pass still contributes.
- `components/computer-use/index.ts`: the `computer-use` skill goes through it; `/computer status` adds
  `skill: your own computer-use skill is active in place of the built-in guide (<path>)` when it yielded. New `env`
  option for the config read.
- `components/x-search/index.ts`: the conditional `x-search` skill goes through it. Both tools stay registered.
- `extension/types.ts`: `getCommands()` entries carry the optional `sourceInfo.path` senpi already reports.

## thread: script-callable SDK (`plugin/runtime/thread-sdk/sdk.js`) for the `omo thread` CLI and connectors

- `components/thread/sdk.ts` (exported from the component barrel): `createThreadSdk({ agentDir, cwd, uid, user,
  engineStatusAll? })` runs every thread operation without an agent session as `cli:<uid>`: `list`, `read`, `send`
  (bindingless = the engine's `cli` sender; with `binding_id` = the connector inbound path, the idempotency key as the
  event id), `bind`/`unbind`/`rebind`/`bindings`/`report`/`outbox`/`ack`/`answer`, `locate` and `release` (senpi
  `release_session` for `omo daemon adopt`). Refusals and transport failures come back as data.
- `tools/gateway-services.ts` and `tools/read-ops.ts`: the store/engine/relay composition and the `thread_list` /
  `thread_read` bodies moved out of `tools.ts`, shared by the tools and the SDK (tool behavior unchanged).
- `gateway/store.ts`: `workerModuleUrl` option (where the worker sidecar is resolved from outside `omo.js`).
  Its worker no longer inherits `--input-type` (node refuses it for a file worker), so an inline
  `node --input-type=module -e` connector script can open the store.
- `live-surface.ts` takes `resolveTaskHostSocket` from `daemon-contract.ts` and `memory/worker/senpi-command.ts` takes
  the launcher helpers from `@oh-my-opencode/senpi-task/rpc-spawn`: the standalone SDK bundle no longer pulls the
  task engine (the full barrel made `bun build --outfile` emit assets and fail).
- Build: new entry `src/extension/thread-sdk.ts` -> `plugin/runtime/thread-sdk/sdk.js` (node builtins only external),
  in `--check`, the installer's required artifacts and the omo-ai payload verifier.
- `sdk.dispose()` cancels the relay's background answer-release retries before closing the store, as the component's
  `session_shutdown` does.
- A completion armed from outside the session reaches a running session: after `report` answers `armed: true`, the
  SDK wakes the session's endpoint (`wake` with no delivery ids, best effort), and the component reads the durable arm
  on that `wake` command edge (`registration.ts` `onCommandWake`, the same lock-free `pendingCompletionArms` read as
  the `session_start` pickup) and writes it at the next settle. An ordinary settle still makes no store call.

## thread: chat-thread bindings, report/outbox/answer relay tools, SQLite tool receipts, gateway send path behind a switch

- `components/thread/tools/relay-tools.ts`, `contracts/`, `metadata.ts`: eight new tools - `thread_bind`,
  `thread_unbind`, `thread_rebind`, `thread_bindings`, `thread_report`, `thread_outbox`, `thread_outbox_ack`,
  `thread_answer` - over the gateway store. A binding attaches a session to one external conversation thread
  (`platform` discord|telegram|slack|herdr|custom, `account_id`, `chat_id`, `thread_id`); one thread has at most one
  active binding (`binding_conflict` names the holder), unbind/rebind are CAS on the revision (`stale_revision`), a
  rebind never extends the TTL (default one week) and refuses work queued under the old revision (`binding_closed`).
  `thread_report` writes only through the calling session's own binding (the originating one by default); a question
  returns an HMAC reply token, and `thread_answer` is refused `binding_mismatch` unless the answer arrives through the
  binding that asked, `stale_token` after a rebind, expiry or session restart, `already_answered` on a replay.
  Completions are armed by `thread_report` and written only when the session settles, with the real outcome. A
  session that armed nothing never opens the gateway store when it settles, and an armed write never holds the settle
  for more than 250 ms: it finishes in the background, retried with the run's own outcome while another process holds
  the store's lock, and an arm made before a restart is written at the session's next settle. Relay text is capped at 32 KiB of
  UTF-8 bytes and refused as `message_too_large`.
- `components/thread/errors.ts`: six new codes (`binding_conflict`, `binding_mismatch`, `binding_inactive`,
  `stale_revision`, `stale_token`, `already_answered`); `loop_detected` now tells the model to answer through
  `thread_read` / `thread_report` / `thread_answer` instead of replying directly.
- `components/thread/tools.ts`: the tools' idempotency receipts move from files under the thread state directory to
  the gateway store's `receipts` table, with the same replay / conflict / in-progress / uncertain behavior.
  `thread_send` / `thread_handoff` can deliver through the gateway engine (results add `delivery_id`,
  `effective_mode`, `endpoint.kind`; new outcome `queued_offline`); that path stays off
  (`THREAD_SENDS_THROUGH_GATEWAY = false` in `component.ts`) until the senpi release with `wake` and
  `admitExternalMessage` is adopted.
- `components/thread/gateway/drain.ts`, `provenance.ts`: a delivery waiting behind the running turn or the user's
  draft shows one notice in the session ("remote message from <actor> queued (<delivery_id>)"); the provenance header
  names the binding and its revision for a delivery that came through one.
- `components/thread/gateway/schema.ts`, `store-ops.ts`, `store-worker.ts`: schema v2 (additive: session
  incarnation, outbox question/answer/outcome columns, per-binding ack cursors, completion arms). Opening a current
  store takes no write lock, and two processes opening a brand-new store at once no longer fail on the WAL switch or
  apply a migration twice. A store operation waits at most 30 s in total for the write lock, so a suspended process
  holding it can no longer stall every store call indefinitely; a session's inbox drain that gives up there retries on
  its own every 5 s until the delivery gets through, and a failed answer hand-off is always returned to pending. A tool
  call whose receipt could not be recorded answers `idempotency_uncertain` on retry instead of `idempotency_in_progress`.

## thread: address book over terminal endpoints with real names/timestamps; sessions drain their gateway inbox

- `components/thread/endpoint-registry.ts`: new. Reads senpi's endpoint registry
  (`<agentDir>/rpc-host-daemon/<16hex>/endpoint.json`, layout 2) without writing or connecting: `endpoint_kind`
  `tui`/`rpc_host` (a record without `registry_version`/`endpoint_kind` reads as `rpc_host`), the directory accepted only
  when the socket's canonical path hashes to it. Used to classify a socket's kind, and to enumerate when the engine's
  `host status --all` cannot.
- `components/thread/live-surface.ts`: `host status --all` rows keep `endpoint_kind`, `alive`/`reason` and a terminal
  owner's session path. A terminal control endpoint (`t-<16hex>.sock`) is reached with its 32-byte secret first and
  only with `get_protocol_info`, `list_sessions`, `get_state`, `get_messages`, `set_session_name`, `wake`, `subscribe`,
  `extension_ui_response`; anything else is refused as `unsupported` before a connection opens, and is answered as
  data by the tools. A terminal the engine reports not alive is not dialed; it is listed from its session file with
  `error_note: "live_unresponsive"`. The surface also exposes the gateway's sender port (`wake`, host-only
  `release_session`, liveness) - a delivery is announced with `wake`, never `prompt`.
- `components/thread/address-book.ts`, `session-facts.ts`, `tools/internals.ts`: every thread carries `endpoint`
  (`kind`, `socket`, `routing_id`), `surface` (`tui` | `desktop` | `child` | `daemon`) and `alive`; its name is the
  session's `/name` (else the first 60 characters of its first user message, never the durable id) and its
  `created_at`/`updated_at` come from the session header and last entry (read from the first and last 64 KiB of the
  file) instead of 1970.
- `components/thread/tools.ts`: `thread_send`/`thread_handoff` to a terminal session answer `unsupported` (a terminal
  takes messages only through its gateway inbox), as do interrupt, model and reasoning changes.
- `components/thread/gateway/registration.ts`, `component.ts`: on an engine that exposes `pi.session`
  (`registerControlEndpoint`, `admissionGate`, `admitExternalMessage`, `listAdmittedDeliveries`, `persistHeaderNow`),
  the thread component persists the session header and registers the session's control endpoint with the gateway
  inbox drain; shutdown disposes the endpoint before the store. On today's engine nothing is registered.
- `components/thread/gateway/store.ts`, `plugin/scripts/build-extension-core.mjs`, `check-extension-current.mjs`,
  `src/install/plugin-artifacts.ts`: the gateway store's worker thread ships as its own build output,
  `extensions/gateway-store-worker.mjs`, beside `omo.js` (a bundler cannot inline a `Worker` entry). The store
  resolves it from its own module location and falls back to `store-worker.ts` in source; `build-extension --check`
  and the installer's required-artifact list include it. Without it the built extension's inbox drain could not open
  its store (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
- `components/thread/gateway/registration.ts`: the store is stamped with `pi.sessionContext.host_instance`, so a host
  `release_session` settles only its own runtime's claims.
- `components/thread/live-surface.ts`: a terminal endpoint whose socket is gone is reported `dead` instead of a raw
  `host_unavailable:<path>`.

## thread: gateway store and delivery engine (SQLite, receipts, causal loop guard)

- `components/thread/gateway/`: new, not wired into the tools yet. One SQLite store at `<agentDir>/gateway/gateway.sqlite`,
  owned by a worker thread so no store call blocks a session loop, holds every cross-session delivery (`deliveries`),
  its idempotency receipt, the causal graph and the rate buckets, plus the `bindings`/`outbox` tables the binding
  tools use. A send writes its row and the target's inbox marker in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction; the target's
  own drain is the only path out of `queued` and marks a row `applied` only after the runtime wrote its transcript
  entry. Loop guards (cycle refusal per causal root, 4 hops, 8-burst/5 s pair bucket, 16 targets per turn, 64
  deliveries per root, 7-day roots, 24 h queue TTL) and a lost-ACK rule (`idempotency_uncertain`, never a resend)
  are enforced in that transaction. The first open migrates a legacy `<cwd>/.omo/thread-tools/mailbox` journal once.
- `components/thread/errors.ts`: new code `loop_detected`.
- `components/thread/gateway/store-ops.ts`: a row claimed by a live host that since released the session
  (`session_released { host_instance, released_at }` in the transcript, naming the claim's own host generation, claimed
  at or before `released_at`) is settled by the disk-token rule like a dead claimant's, instead of reading
  `dual_runtime` forever. A claim by any other runtime, or made after the release, stays `dual_runtime`.
- `components/thread/gateway/adapter.ts`: provisional senpi types aligned with the branches (registration union,
  `release_session` request/refusal shape, drain result mapping).
- `omo-native/test/sqlite-import-discipline.test.ts`: covers the gateway; only `store-worker.ts` imports `node:sqlite`,
  lazily.

## memory: a late Kibitzer verdict no longer steers an extra turn after the final answer

- `components/memory/kibitzer/delivery.ts`: an accepted verdict steers at once only while the running session has a
  tool call executing. The host reads its steering queue after every turn, so a steer queued once the final answer
  was streaming or streamed started one more assistant turn after it; a headless `senpi -p` consumer that posts only
  the last assistant text then lost the real answer (observed as `answer -> omo-kibitzer:recall -> "NO_REPLY"`). Such a
  verdict is now held for the next `tool_result` steer or the next prompt's drain, like any other held nudge.
- `components/memory/kibitzer/hooks.ts`: `tool_call` / `tool_result` report the executing call ids to delivery, and a
  new `turn_end` hook clears them so a call that never reports a result (blocked, aborted) cannot outlive its turn.

## model-profile, task: builtin lanes and the category notice never route to an unlisted gateway (#9146)

- `components/model-profile/resolve.ts`: every builtin rung, in `recommended` and in the `daily-*`/`geeky-*` lanes, is
  served only by its listed providers, so a lane never lands the session on a gateway's copy of its model
  (`opengateway/anthropic/claude-opus-5-5`). A lane no listed provider serves is `unavailable` and keeps the session
  model with the existing one-line notice. A user's bare model id, which names no provider, still matches anywhere.
  `rankedProvidersOnly` is gone: it was the only builtin that had the listed-only rule, which is now the rule.
- `components/task/category-unavailable-warning.ts`: when only an unlisted provider serves a hidden category's chain,
  the one notice per session names it and the exact opt-in line
  (`categories.<name>.model = "<gateway>/<model>"`); `details.unlisted_provider_model` carries it for remote clients.
